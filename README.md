# Ray2Fix

Ray2Fix is a collection of fixes and a configuration tool that aims to simplify setting up Rayman 2 for speedrunners.

It can also be used as a basic mod loader (can be enabled in Tweaks tab in R2FixCfg.exe).

## How to Install

#### Game versions:
- Recommended: The [GOG.com version](https://www.gog.com/game/rayman_2_the_great_escape) of the game installed using the [standalone installer](https://www.gog.com/downloads/rayman_2_the_great_escape/en1installer0).
- Retail CD/DVD versions are not supported (due to a different game EXE that includes DRM).
- GOG Galaxy is not recommended, but should work (use the standalone installer if possible).
- Uplay/Ubisoft Connect is not officially supported - try at your own risk.

#### Guide:
- Download the **[latest release zip](https://github.com/spitfirex86/Ray2Fix/releases/latest)** and extract all files to Rayman 2 installation directory.
- Run R2FixCfg.exe and choose your preferred display settings in the General tab.
- (Optional) Customize the controller layout in the Gamepad tab.

#### Controller troubleshooting:
- Make sure the controller supports XInput.
- Make sure only one controller is plugged in (including virtual controllers).
